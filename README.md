# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices based on key features extracted from the AmesHousing dataset using a full machine learning pipeline in Python.

## Project Overview

This is an end-to-end pipeline that includes:

- *Data Ingestion* from raw CSV
- *Data Cleaning* (handling missing values, dropping high-null columns)
- *Feature Engineering* (encoding, transformations)
- *Model Training* (Gradient Boosting and others)
- *Model Evaluation* (R2, RMSE, MAE, Accuracy within 10%)
- *API Deployment* using FastAPI
- *Interactive Frontend* to test predictions
